Currently, my main teaching obligations are as examiner and course leader in TDDD14/TDDD85 (automata theory and formal languages), TDP015 (introduction to mathematics), and TDDD08 (logic programming).

Interested in doing a theoretically oriented thesis in computer science or discrete mathematics? Feel free to contact me for recent proposals.
